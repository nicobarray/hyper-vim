# Hyper theme for vim

> A hyper logo inspired theme for vim

⚠️ This is a work in progress, therefore some highlights may feel wrong. My goal is to fix them
as I found them. I mosly use vim for javascript and it could make the over langages syntax looks
weird. Do not esitate to fork it and make it yours!

Also, I'm currently working on the pangoss/vim-javascript compatibility. 

## Install

Using your favorite vim plugin bundler (Plug, Vundle, Bundle, Plugin, etc)

```
  Plug 'nicobarray/hyper-vim'
```

Or clone this repository and copy the 'colors/hyper.vim' into your ~/.vim/colors directory.

Then add

```
set syntax on
colorscheme hyper
```

to your ~/.vimrc

Enjoy !
